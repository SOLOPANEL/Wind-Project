# Wind-Project
This is my first project that I built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.


You get real-time info: No more guessing games. We pull live data for temperature, humidity, and wind speed, so you're always in the know.

It's a breeze to use: The design is sharp and simple. You just type in a city, and everything you need pops up in a neat little card.

The visuals are spot on: The app doesn't just tell you what the weather isâ€”it shows you. The icon changes to match the conditions, whether it's a sunny day, a drizzle, or a full-on downpour.

It actually works: If you accidentally type in the wrong city name, no worries. It handles that with a friendly message instead of just breaking.

It's fast and smooth: Built using simple code, it's super lightweight and feels great to use on any device.
